Subsystems
Drivetrain - 4x TalonSRX CANs.

Elevator - 1x talon pwm motor, 1x quad encoder, 2x limit switches
- limit switches are dead-man - cuts power to elevator motor if tripped
  - not intended to be restartable
  intended to prevent damage to subsystem
    - has benefit to run motor until it hits start position so we can
      reset the subsystem after/before a match
- encoder used to determine relative position during operation
  starts at zero & determines +/- from zero. Can be used to determine
  whether to go up or down based on operator instruction
- Functions
 - __init__ zero encoder count
 - Reset - put back in start posistion
 - GotoPosistion(enum position)
 - Kill() stop all action - deadman

Arm - 1x talon pwm motor, 1x quad encoder, 2x limit switches
- limit switches are deadman as above.
- encoder counts clicks, IE how many rotations to put arm into desired position
- Functions
 - __init__ - zero encoder count
 - Reset - put back in start posistion
 - GotoPosistion(enum position)
 - Kill() stop all action - deadman

Ingester - 1x talon pwm motor
- simple ingest, expel action - run motor CW, CCW under operator control.
- Functions:
  - Ingest
  - Expel

Commands
 GotoPosition(position)
 possible positions:
  - Stowed - original starting state
  - Deployed - 1st get-ready on match start
  - Accept/Deliver hatch - lower level
  - Deliver hatch - mid level
  - Deliver Ball - lower level
  - Deliver Ball - mid level
  - Pickup ball - ground level
Uses addParallel to move elevator and arm in concert

Operator Interface
- Stick A - used for manual control - drive train actuator.
- Button A - whenPressed(GotoPosition(Initial))

- Stick B -Button Board
- Button A whenPressed(GotoPosition(Ground))
- Button B whenPressed(GotoPosition(LowHatch))
- Button C whenPressed(GotoPosition(LowBall))
- Button D whenPressed(GotoPosition(MidHatch))
- Button E whenPressed(GotoPosistion(MidBall))
- Button F whileHeld(Ingest())
- Button G whileHeld(Expel())
